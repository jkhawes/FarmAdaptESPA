1. Farm-Adapt Purpose, Content, and Development

Project purpose: 
The team set out to better understand the implications of the adopted decision-making model for 
the results and conclusions of a modeling effort. To do this, the team has sought to produce a 
generalizable model of industrialized farmer adaptation to resource scarcity. The implementation of 
three separate, theory-based decision-making mechanisms to govern farmer agent behavior within a 
fully functional model of an agricultural system allows the study team to expand the collective 
understanding of the type of variability introduced when decision-making rules are varied. In doing 
so, we draw attention to the intentionality with which decision-making rules should be selected and 
designed. 

Content: 
The Farm-Adapt GitHub repository is an evolving set of content. To date, it is dominted by the Idaho 
Case Study for which this model was originally designed. Moving forward, the team seeks to release an
unoperationalized Farm-Adapt model for ease of use in the instance of new case studies. In the meantime, 
this READ-ME guides the user through both the Idaho Case Study and through re-operationalization of the model. 

Development: 
Farm-Adapt was developed and designed by Jason K Hawes. Jason can be reached at jasonkhawes@gmail.com. For
more information on the initial use and testing of the model, see _______________________________________. 
The model is designed to run using only free and open source software (NetLogo and R) and operate in any 
environment with access to those programs. The model is designed for use by researchers and practitioners 
interested in adaptation in industrialized agriculture as well asdecision-making theory. To this end, the 
interface is designed to allow for easy investigation of the agricultural and economic inputs and outcome 
variables, as well as to support a thorough understanding of the operationalization of social science theory.
