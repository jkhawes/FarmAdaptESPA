4. Components
The model is designed as a collection of components, with minimal coding within the main NetLogo
file. These components can be divide into two main categories, Simulation and Analysis. Analysis
components are primarily dedicated to the integration of R in the program. Simulation components 
are divided into four main categories detailed below. More details on each components can be found 
in the sub-files 4a-4e. 


Farmers are the only actors with true agency. They proceed through a four-season year, which 
approximates their real-world schedule.
1.	Planning season – traditional: Farmers determine preferred crop, plan for planting 
	that best meets their requirements – may still be revised in adaptation planning. 
	With each crop, farmers calculate their expected water use and analyze various water-saving 
	measures, including more efficient irrigation, less water-intensive crops, and fallowing 
	acres or corners. This is all considered in an overall utility function that uses the 
	selected decision-making theory to approximate a farmer’s decision-making process in light 
	of available information. 
2.	Planting season: Farmers execute plan developed in planning season. Simulation determines 
	total water use by farmers, yields (AquaCrop), and net revenue.
3.	Harvest Season (Reconciliation): Farmers calculate their yield and income and adapt their 
	attitudes based on this year’s outcomes.  
4.	Offseason: Farmers communicate results with other farmers and with consultants in their 
	social network. Afterwards, consultants speak with their farmer clients about the new 
	attitudes they’ve developed after seeing that year’s performance for a variety of farmers. 
Other agents only participate in the offseason section of the model, communicating with farmers and sharing their opinions about each possible crop and irrigation method.
